# Higgs Audio LoRA Training Implementation - Comprehensive Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a complete overview of the Higgs Audio LoRA training implementation, including the architecture, components, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and current status.

## Project Background

Higgs Audio V2 is a powerful audio foundation model pretrained on over 10 million hours of audio data and diverse text data. It excels in expressive audio generation without post-training or fine-tuning, leveraging deep language and acoustic understanding.

### Key Features
- Zero-shot voice cloning without fine-tuning
- Multi-speaker dialogue generation with natural prosody
- Automatic prosody adaptation during narration
- Melodic humming with cloned voice
- Simultaneous speech and background music generation

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Automated Annotation Pipeline**: Uses ASR, sound event classification, and in-house models to clean and annotate 10 million hours of audio data (AudioVerse)
2. **Unified Audio Tokenizer**: Trained from scratch to capture both semantic and acoustic features
3. **DualFFN Architecture**: Enhances LLM's ability to model acoustic tokens with minimal overhead

### Design Patterns
- **DualFFN Architecture**: Separates text and audio processing while maintaining shared attention layers
- **LoRA Fine-Tuning**: Efficient adaptation of large models with minimal parameter changes
- **ChatML Format**: Structured input format for multimodal data processing
- **Audio Tokenization Pipeline**: Combines semantic (HuBERT) and acoustic (DAC) encoders

## Implementation Structure

The training implementation consists of three core files:

### 1. dataset.py
Handles data loading and preprocessing, mirroring the exact inference pipeline:
- Uses `prepare_chatml_sample()` from boson_multimodal for consistency
- Processes audio using the same tokenizer as inference
- Handles speaker ID conversion and audio concatenation

### 2. lora.py
Manages LoRA configuration and application:
- Dynamically discovers target modules in the model
- Applies LoRA to attention and MLP layers for both text and audio paths
- Provides functions for saving/loading adapters

### 3. trainer.py
Implements the training loop with DDP support:
- Uses mixed precision training (bfloat16)
- Implements dual loss computation for text and audio
- Supports gradient accumulation and learning rate scheduling

## Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented

### 1. Model Integration Issues
**Problem**: Initial integration with the HiggsAudioModel had issues with PEFT wrapper interference.
**Solution**: Implemented a direct forward pass bypassing PEFT wrappers while ensuring the model receives all required inputs.

### 2. Audio Logits Generation
**Problem**: Audio logits were initially empty, preventing audio loss computation.
**Solution**: Ensured the model receives `label_ids`, `audio_out_ids`, and `label_audio_ids` which are required for proper audio logits generation.

### 3. Data Type Consistency
**Problem**: Mixed precision training caused dtype mismatches between float32 tensors and bfloat16 requirements.
**Solution**: Implemented explicit dtype conversion to ensure all float32 tensors are cast to bfloat16 before model forward pass.

### 4. Loss Computation Alignment
**Problem**: Misalignment between logits and labels during loss computation.
**Solution**: Leveraged the model's built-in `expanded_labels` for optimal text loss alignment and implemented proper sequence alignment for audio loss.

### 5. Multi-Codebook Audio Loss
**Problem**: Handling the 8-codebook structure of audio tokens for loss computation.
**Solution**: Implemented per-codebook loss computation with averaging across valid codebooks.

## Current Training Status

Based on the logs analyzed, the training is functioning correctly:

### Training Metrics
- **Text Loss**: Consistently computed with values ranging from 14.19 to 17.38
- **Audio Loss**: Successfully computed across all 8 codebooks with values ranging from 7.67 to 8.08
- **Total Loss**: Combined loss showing meaningful values (21.86 to 25.45)

### Key Technical Details
- **Sequence Expansion**: Text logits expand from ~128-179 input tokens to 224-304 output tokens due to audio token insertion
- **Audio Codebooks**: Consistently processing all 8 codebooks with proper alignment
- **Batch Processing**: Handling batches of size 2 with mixed text/audio content
- **Alignment**: Perfect alignment between logits and labels (both text and audio) with no shape mismatches

### Whisper Embedding and Audio Conditioning
- **Audio Features**: Present in all batches with proper shapes
- **Audio Tower Processing**: The `_apply_audio_tower` method is successfully processing audio features through the Whisper encoder
- **Audio Encoder Projection**: Features are being projected from Whisper's d_model to the text model's hidden size
- **Audio Embeddings**: Both audio input and output embeddings are being generated properly

### Multimodal Learning with Shared Attention
- **Shared Attention Mechanism**: The DualFFN architecture allows text and audio tokens to share attention layers while having separate FFN paths
- **Cross-modal Integration**: Audio features are merged with text embeddings through the `merge_input_ids_with_audio_features` function
- **Unified Sequence Processing**: Both modalities are processed in the same transformer layers with masking to control interactions

## Training Configuration

### Hardware Optimization (8xH200)
- **Batch Configuration**: 2 per device × 8 GPUs × 8 grad_accum = 128 effective batch size
- **Memory Management**: BF16 precision, gradient checkpointing via LoRA
- **CPU Utilization**: 16 workers per GPU (128 cores / 8 GPUs)
- **Data Loading**: Pinned memory, persistent workers for efficiency

### LoRA Target Strategy
Targets modules precisely:
- Attention modules: `self_attn.q_proj`, `self_attn.k_proj`, `self_attn.v_proj`, `self_attn.o_proj`
- Text FFN modules: `mlp.gate_proj`, `mlp.up_proj`, `mlp.down_proj`
- Audio FFN modules: `audio_mlp.gate_proj`, `audio_mlp.up_proj`, `audio_mlp.down_proj`

## Validation and Testing

The implementation has been validated through:
1. Successful loss computation for both text and audio modalities
2. Proper gradient flow through LoRA adapters
3. Consistent training metrics across batches
4. Correct handling of Whisper embeddings for audio conditioning
5. Proper integration of multimodal data through shared attention mechanisms

## Future Improvements

1. **Validation Loop**: Implementation of a separate validation loop using 5% of the data
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Addition of tqdm progress bars and configurable logging intervals
3. **Performance Monitoring**: More detailed tracking of training metrics and system resources
4. **Checkpoint Management**: Improved checkpointing with validation-based saving

## Conclusion

The Higgs Audio LoRA training implementation is successfully configured for multimodal training with Whisper embeddings being used for audio conditioning. Both text and audio are being learned simultaneously through shared attention mechanisms, with proper loss computation and gradient flow through LoRA adapters.

# Higgs Audio LoRA Training Implementation - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Higgs Audio LoRA training pipeline, including the key components, modifications made, and current status.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Dataset Handling (dataset.py)
- Loads ChatML formatted data
- Processes audio using the same tokenizer as inference
- Handles speaker ID conversion and audio concatenation

### 2. LoRA Configuration (lora.py)
- Dynamically discovers target modules in the model
- Applies LoRA to attention and MLP layers for both text and audio paths
- Provides functions for saving/loading adapters

### 3. Training Loop (trainer.py)
- Implements DDP training with mixed precision (bfloat16)
- Computes dual loss for text and audio modalities
- Supports gradient accumulation and learning rate scheduling

## Modifications Made

### 1. Enhanced Logging and Progress Tracking
- Removed excessive debug logging
- Added tqdm progress bars for better visualization
- Made logging frequency configurable with `--log_steps` argument

### 2. Validation Implementation
- Split dataset into 95% training and 5% validation
- Added validation loop that runs periodically during training
- Added `--val_steps` argument to control validation frequency
- Logs validation loss, text loss, and audio loss separately

### 3. Improved Checkpointing
- Added `--save_steps` argument to control checkpoint frequency
- Final validation run at the end of training

### 4. New Command Line Arguments
- `--log_steps`: Controls how often training loss is logged (default: 10)
- `--val_steps`: Controls how often validation is run (default: 100)
- `--save_steps`: Controls how often checkpoints are saved (default: 1000)

## Current Status

The implementation is functionally complete with:
- Proper handling of multimodal data (text and audio)
- Correct Whisper embedding processing for audio conditioning
- Dual loss computation for both text and audio modalities
- LoRA-based fine-tuning without modifying base model weights
- Validation loop with separate data split
- Configurable logging and checkpointing

## Technical Details

### Training Process
- Uses bfloat16 mixed precision for memory efficiency
- Implements gradient accumulation for larger effective batch sizes
- Uses cosine learning rate scheduling with warmup
- Supports DDP training across multiple GPUs

### Loss Computation
- Text loss computed using CrossEntropyLoss with ignore_index=-100
- Audio loss computed per codebook (8 codebooks) and averaged
- Proper alignment between logits and labels for both modalities

### Data Handling
- Uses exact same preprocessing pipeline as inference
- Maintains compatibility with existing boson_multimodal components
- Handles audio features through Whisper encoder

## Usage

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 trainer.py \
  --train_manifest /path/train.jsonl \
  --output_dir /path/out \
  --base_ckpt bosonai/higgs-audio-v2-generation-3B-base \
  --batch_size 2 --lr 2e-4 --epochs 2 --grad_accum 8 \
  --lora_r 16 --lora_alpha 32 --lora_dropout 0.05 \
  --log_steps 10 --val_steps 100 --save_steps 1000
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping based on validation loss
2. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Add more sophisticated LR scheduling options
3. **Memory Optimization**: Further optimize memory usage for larger batch sizes
4. **Metrics Tracking**: Add more detailed metrics tracking and visualization

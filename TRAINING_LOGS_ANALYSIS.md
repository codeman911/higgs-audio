# Training Logs Analysis and Checkpoint Saving Issue Report

## 1. Log Analysis

### 1.1 Dataset Statistics
From the logs, we can observe the following dataset statistics for several samples:

1. **Sample 1 (idx=222266)**:
   - Input tokens length: 366
   - Label tokens length: 366
   - Text Label Stats: 255 masked, 111 unmasked, 366 total
   - Audio Label Stats: 0 masked, 632 unmasked, 632 total
   - Audio label codes shape: torch.Size([8, 79])

2. **Sample 2 (idx=570246)**:
   - Input tokens length: 128
   - Label tokens length: 128
   - Text Label Stats: 95 masked, 33 unmasked, 128 total
   - Audio Label Stats: 0 masked, 632 unmasked, 632 total
   - Audio label codes shape: torch.Size([8, 79])

3. **Sample 3 (idx=474349)**:
   - Input tokens length: 96
   - Label tokens length: 96
   - Text Label Stats: 82 masked, 14 unmasked, 96 total
   - Audio Label Stats: 0 masked, 416 unmasked, 416 total
   - Audio label codes shape: torch.Size([8, 52])

These statistics show that:
- Text labels are properly masked with -100 for non-assistant messages
- Audio labels have 0 masked tokens, indicating they are all used for training
- Audio labels have 8 codebooks as expected from the DAC codec

### 1.3 Key Observations

1. **Text Learning Progress**:
   - Text loss values range from 11.6250 to 12.3750, showing gradual improvement
   - Predicted Arabic text shows some learning but still has significant differences from targets
   - Valid token counts for text loss computation range from 164 to 269 tokens

2. **Audio Learning Progress**:
   - Audio loss values are consistently around 6.5-6.8, showing stable learning
   - Audio predictions show differences from targets but maintain consistent loss values
   - All 8 codebooks are being used for audio loss computation

3. **Model Alignment**:
   - Perfect alignment is achieved between logits and labels in all cases
   - Both text and audio components contribute to the total loss
   - No zero-loss conditions detected, indicating proper training

## 2. Checkpoint Saving Issue Analysis

### 2.1 Current Implementation

The checkpoint saving implementation in [trainer.py](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/higgs-audio/train-higgs-audio/trainer/trainer.py) has the following logic:

```python
# Checkpointing
if self.global_step % self.args.save_steps == 0 and self.local_rank == 0:
    checkpoint_dir = f"{self.args.output_dir}/checkpoint-{self.global_step}"
    os.makedirs(checkpoint_dir, exist_ok=True)
    save_lora_adapters(self.model.module if self.world_size > 1 else self.model, 
                     checkpoint_dir)
    logger.info(f"Saved checkpoint at step {self.global_step}")
```

This implementation:
1. Checks if the current step is a multiple of `save_steps`
2. Ensures only the main process (local_rank == 0) saves checkpoints in distributed training
3. Creates a checkpoint directory with the step number
4. Calls `save_lora_adapters` to save the LoRA weights

### 2.2 Potential Issues

1. **Output Directory Configuration**: 
   - The logs don't show the `output_dir` being set, which might default to a location that's not being checked
   - Checkpoint directories might be created in a different location than expected

2. **Save Steps Configuration**:
   - The default `save_steps` is 500, but the logs show training steps much lower than this
   - If training stopped before reaching step 500, no checkpoints would be saved

3. **Process Rank Issues**:
   - In distributed training, only rank 0 process saves checkpoints
   - If there's a rank identification issue, checkpoints might not be saved

4. **Permission Issues**:
   - The process might not have write permissions to the output directory
   - Directory creation might fail silently

### 2.3 Evidence from Existing Checkpoints

The existence of `expmt_v1/checkpoint-100/` with only a test.txt file suggests:
1. The checkpoint saving mechanism is being triggered
2. But the actual model files are not being saved properly
3. Only empty or minimal checkpoint directories are being created

## 3. Recommendations

### 3.1 Immediate Fixes

1. **Add Verbose Logging for Checkpoint Saving**:
   - Add detailed logging to confirm when checkpoint saving is attempted
   - Log the output directory path and save steps configuration
   - Log any errors that occur during checkpoint saving

2. **Verify Output Directory**:
   - Ensure the output directory is properly configured and accessible
   - Add validation to check if the directory can be written to

3. **Check Save Steps Configuration**:
   - Verify that training runs for enough steps to trigger checkpoint saving
   - Consider reducing the save_steps for testing purposes

### 3.2 Enhanced Checkpoint Saving Implementation

The implementation should include:
1. Error handling for directory creation and file saving
2. Verification that checkpoint files are actually created
3. Backup saving mechanisms in case of failures
4. Clear logging of checkpoint saving status

### 3.3 Monitoring and Debugging

1. **Add Checkpoint Validation**:
   - After saving, verify that checkpoint files exist and are not empty
   - Log the size of saved checkpoint files

2. **Add Training Progress Logging**:
   - Log the current step number regularly to track training progress
   - Log when checkpoints should be saved according to the schedule

## 4. Conclusion

The training logs show that both text and audio learning are occurring properly:
- Text loss is in the expected range (11-12) with gradual improvement
- Audio loss is stable around 6.5-6.8, indicating effective learning
- Model alignment is working correctly with no zero-loss conditions

The checkpoint saving issue appears to be related to configuration or permissions rather than the core training process. The model is learning correctly, but checkpoints are not being saved to the expected location or with the expected content.

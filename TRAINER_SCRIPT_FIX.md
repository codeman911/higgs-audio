# Trainer Script Fix

## Issue
The trainer script was not running properly after recent modifications. The issue was that the file was truncated and missing the essential `parse_args()` and `main()` functions at the end of the file.

## Root Cause
During the logging optimization process, the end of the file was accidentally truncated, removing the crucial functions needed to run the script:
- `parse_args()` - Parses command line arguments
- `main()` - Main entry point for the training script
- `if __name__ == "__main__":` - Script execution guard

## Fix Applied
Restored the missing functions from the git history:

1. **parse_args()** - Complete argument parser with all required training parameters
2. **main()** - Main function that initializes the trainer and starts training
3. **if __name__ == "__main__":** - Script execution guard

## Verification
The fix has been verified by:
- ✅ Successful import of the trainer module
- ✅ Successful compilation of the trainer.py file
- ✅ Access to all classes and functions in the module

## Files Modified
- `trainer.py` - Restored missing functions at the end of the file

## Testing
The script should now run correctly with the torchrun command:
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 trainer.py \
  --train_manifest training_data/chatml/train_chatml_samples.json \
  --output_dir expmt_v2 \
  --base_ckpt bosonai/higgs-audio-v2-generation-3B-base \
  --batch_size 2 \
  --lr 1e-4 \
  --wd 0.01 \
  --epochs 1 \
  --grad_accum 8 \
  --val_steps 500 \
  --save_steps 10
```

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always verify the file structure after making changes
2. Use version control to track changes
3. Test script execution after modifications
4. Keep backups of working versions
